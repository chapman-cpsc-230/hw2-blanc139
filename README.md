## Description

Second official homework. Create Sum of Powers program & Cooling program to estimate the current temperature of a cup of tea in terms of minutes passed.

## What I Learned from This

I learned how to successfully use "while" loops and used them to create mathematical programs, specifically, the sum of powers and a program to estimate the temperature of a cup of tea as it cools.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
